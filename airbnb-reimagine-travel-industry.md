# Airbnb - Reimagining the Travel Industry

- people moving to urban
- urban life is different
- millenials are most living generation, and growing
- most millenials will spend money on "experiences" not "things"
- that makes "sharing economy" happens
- born 1995 is generation Z ... also growing
- millenials use 3 screens... gen Z uses 5 screens (screen = way)
- they consume media with self research and with education
- they tend to buy more things online
- they tend to do things online
- mobile first is thus important
- 4.7 B internet users by 2025 ... this is a fast growing figure
- the trend here is millenials will "share" everything... it starts from cars and homes ... but something is possible
- they're sharing garderns ! tools ! plants ! pets ! electricity !
- they is a start up working on pets sharing

## Travel is changing:
- asia pacific is the fastest growing region
- and the driver for this growth is "south-east asia" !
- and in the sound-east asia "Thailand" is the top driver !, esp. foreigners traveling to Thailand
- Air passenger is growing really fast ! 2014 it is 3.3 B a year
- International tourists are at 1.1 B at 2014
- 10% of world's GDP is tourism
- big part of south east asia GDP is tourism
- 20% of Thailand's GDP is tourism
- this is much contributed by Chinese travelers
- Chinese travelers want to experience like "locals"
- travel is being "democratized"

## Our economy is changing:
- new generations enjoy freelancing
- more and more start ups depend on sharing economy
- sharing home is not really new ... but Airbnb just made it more accessible
- sharing home is more than an accommodation ... it is more like experience with local people, local foods and so on ... it is not provided by any hotel
- sharing economy is expected to be 335 B at 2025 (~30 times from 2015)
- older generations starting to adopt sharing economy
- older generations like to "welcome" people .. they kinda proud of their ceties
- actually, AirBnb generates a lot of money for these retired people
- many older people are not easy to travel ... but sharing homes is bringing travels to them without leaving their homes
- AirBnb brings tourists to rural areas
- AirBnb takes only 3% fee
